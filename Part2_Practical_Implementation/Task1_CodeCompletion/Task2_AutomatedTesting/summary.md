# Task 2 — Automated Testing Summary (150 words)

Tool used: Selenium IDE (or Testim.io)

Test cases:
- Valid login: correct username and password -> expect successful redirect/dashboard.
- Invalid login: wrong credentials -> expect error message "Invalid credentials".

I recorded the test steps in Selenium IDE and ran them multiple times. The AI-assisted testing tools (Testim or Selenium with AI helpers) help by auto-healing selectors when the UI changes and by suggesting additional edge-case steps, increasing test coverage.

Results:
- Valid login: PASS
- Invalid login: PASS (error shown)
